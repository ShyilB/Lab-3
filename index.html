  <h2><em> If You Give A Mouse a Cookie </em>, by Don Freeman</h2>
  <p>A boy gives a mouse a cookie.</p>
  <p>The mouse then asks for milk and a series of requests begins where the boy generously grants the mouse's wishes. After a long day of requests and the ensuing activities, the boy and the mouse sit down together and enjoy another cookie.</p>
  <h2><em> Green Eggs and Ham</em>, by Dr.Seuss </h2>
  <p>Green Eggs and Ham is a classic story about a picky eater. </p>
  <p>The nameless main character refuses to try green eggs and ham. Throughout the book, his friend Sam-I-am keeps insisting that he'd like them. Sam suggests all different places to try this dish, but his friend keeps refusing.</p>
  <h2><em> The Cat In The Hat </em>, Dr.Seuss </h2>
  <p>When Sally and her brother are left alone on a rainy day, they think they are in for a dull time - but then the Cat in the Hat steps onto the mat, bringing with him madness and mayhem.</p>
  <p>Children will love the rhyming text, bold illustrations, and most of all the naughty Cat himself.</p>
